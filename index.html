            Hi! I’m Akshat Bawa, a second-year undergraduate at the Indian Institute of Technology Ropar, pursuing B. Tech. in Mathematics and Computing. I have a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics — fields where logical rigor meets innovation.
          </p>

          <p>
            In Summer 2024, I interned as a Teaching Assistant at the AI Vicharana Shala organized by iHub AWaDH & the CSE Department at IIT Ropar, where I worked with Python, Linear Algebra, and core ML concepts — and got to guide others through it too.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond academics, I actively contribute to campus life – I’m an Event Coordinator in the Music Club (Alankar), a Student Mentor under the Institute Student Mentorship Program, and served as an Event Co-Head at our Annual Cultural Fest, Zeitgeist. These roles have honed my leadership, organizational, and teamwork skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eager to connect with professionals and explore opportunities in SD and related fields that offer growth and hands-on experience.
            <br>
            Always happy to connect and collaborate!
          </p>
